Included in the tarball are the following files:
lab1.c	 : My program with the given specifications on the project spec
Makefile 
README
gdb1.png : gdb screen shot for backtrace
gdb2.png : gdb screen shot for breakpoint and variable inspection

My program will allow the user to feed input through stdin or through a file given the argument --input=<file_name> is given. Output will be by default fed out of stdout unless the user provides the argument --output=<output_file> in which the input will be copied into a newly made file with provided name. --segfault causes a segmentation fault by assigning a value to a NULL pointer, and --catch calls signal(SIGSEGV, <handler>) before the segmentation fault occurs.

I tested my implementation inside the Makefile by making some test files with text and comparing input to output by diff-ing the two. I also checked the return codes for --segfault and --catch.

'make check' Tests:
I tested my program with different combinations of the presense of input and output files. I tested in the Makefile when an input file is specified and an output file is not. And I tested when both input and output files were specified. I checked to make sure input and output were the same by calling diff on the input and output. I also tested my program's return values when arguments --segfault and --segfault --catch were passed in.
