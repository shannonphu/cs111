I used the socket library to form a connection between my client and server. The client
reads from stdin and writes input to the display as well as sends it to the server
through the socket. The server passes the input received from the client through
the pipe connection to the shell and also reads the shell's output and passes it
back to the client through the socket.

I implemented the --log option by storing all stdin input into a buffer and separately
storing all received output into another buffer. When a ^D was detected, I would
then write input and output to the file in this form:

SENT 10 bytes: ls
pwd
man

RECEIVED 101 bytes: client
client.c
lab1b-404403562.tar.gz
log
Makefile
my.key
old_versions
README
server
server.c
trial
...


Since I pretty much write to the log file on exit, and the ^C signal immediately exits,
my program does not write to the log file when ^C is entered.

For the --encrypt option I used libmcrypt and set up the module as so:
mcrypt_module_open(MCRYPT_TWOFISH, NULL, MCRYPT_CFB, NULL );
Then I encrypted and decrypted 1 character at a time as it was send/received.
